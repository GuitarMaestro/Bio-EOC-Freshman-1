My First Website Project

Hey! This is my very first attempt at creating and launching a website using GitHub Pages. It's a simple project, but it's a huge milestone for me in learning how to build and share things online.

What This Is
This site is a beginner-level project, created to test out how to:
- Upload HTML/CSS/JS files to GitHub
- Host a website using GitHub Pages
- Start understanding web development and version control

I made it using just the basics — no fancy frameworks, just raw HTML, some CSS, and a whole lot of trial and error.

 What I Learned
- How to create a GitHub repository
- How to use GitHub Pages to publish a site
- How to fix small bugs 
- That it’s okay to not know everything at the start — progress matters!

## 🛠️ Known Issues / Bugs
There might be a few things that don’t work perfectly yet — I’m still learning and improving as I go. If you find anything broken, or something looks weird, feel free to let me know!

## 📬 Contact
If you run into any issues with the site or just want to give feedback or tips (which I’d seriously appreciate!), feel free to reach out to me:

Thanks for checking this out! I'm excited to keep learning and building better things from here on.
